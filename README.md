## Overview
  - Every block is now pixelated.
  - Forgotten blocks return!
  
And in the experimental branch,
  - an attempt to replicate 3.5 gameplay.

All new/modified blocks are carefully redrawn with full respect for the original style, palette, and using old sprites.  
Hope you enjoy this mod, as we have making it!
