# Mindustry Classicified
Have you ever wanted to play Mindustry, but was dissatisfied with how much 5.0 changed compared to 3.5? Then this mod is for you!

## Features
  - Every block is now pixelated.
  - Forgotten blocks return!
  
And in the experimental branch,
  - an attempt to replicate 3.5 gameplay.

Hope you enjoy this mod, as I have making it!
